DiffRim: A Diffusion-Driven Model for High Efficiency Radar Interference Mitigation (Submitted to ICASSP 2026)

1-Data generation

The large-scale synthetic dataset based on RaDICaL [1] and simulated interference can be downloaded from https://pan.baidu.com/s/1uaPoF-a1bvdRph_d3bClVw?pwd=w166 (code: w166), or generated following the steps in folder '1-Data_generation'. 
‘radar_raw_cube’ in the MATLAB script is referred to as Radar raw ADC data extracted from RaDICaL .bag files.

2-Train the model
